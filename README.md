ðŸš€ Unveiling Hidden Insights in Retail Sales!

A few weeks ago, I took on a data-driven challengeâ€”understanding customer behavior and optimizing sales strategies using real-world retail data. ðŸ“Š

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Data Extraction & Transformation
I started by extracting data from the Kaggle API and cleaning it using Pandas & NumPy, ensuring accuracy for meaningful analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Loading into PostgreSQL & Querying
Once the data was structured, I loaded it into PostgreSQL and wrote SQL queries to extract key business insights.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Data Analysis & Visualization
Using Matplotlib & Seaborn, I visualized patterns to answer critical business questions, such as:
âœ… Top 10 revenue-generating products
âœ… Top 5 best-selling products in each region
âœ… Month-over-month growth for 2022 vs 2023
âœ… Which category had its peak sales in which month?
âœ… Which sub-category had the highest profit growth in 2023 vs 2022?

âœ¨ Key Takeaways:
ðŸ“Œ Seasonal trends impact sales significantly.
ðŸ“Œ Some products drive consistent revenue, while others peak in specific months.
ðŸ“Œ Identifying high-growth subcategories can help businesses optimize inventory & marketing.

This project reinforced my passion for data analytics and how it can drive business decisions. ðŸš€
